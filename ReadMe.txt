Two of my programmer buddies  asked me to write demo of flip-flop threads algorithm.
So here it is. 
Dog in one thread will woof, then cat in other thread will meow, then switch. 

Other examples:
Print Even and Odd numbers in c# using two thread ie even thread and odd thread
Even and Odd number sequence with 2 threads in C# Program
